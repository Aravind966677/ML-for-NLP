# ML-for-NLP
# Natural Language Processing Pipeline

This repository contains a comprehensive Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline implementation using Python. The pipeline demonstrates various fundamental NLP techniques and transformations using popular libraries such as NLTK, scikit-learn, and gensim.

## Features

## NLP Techniques Overview

| Technique | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Tokenization | Breaks text into words or sentences. |
| Stemming | Simplifies words to their root forms. |
| Lemmatization | Reduces words to their base/dictionary forms. |
| Stopwords Removal | Eliminates common, non-informative words. |
| POS Tagging | Assigns grammatical roles to words. |
| NER | Detects named entities like names, places. |
| One-Hot Encoding | Binary representation of words. |
| Bag of Words (BoW) | Word frequency representation. |
| n-grams | Combines adjacent words into sequences. |
| TF-IDF | Weighs words by frequency and uniqueness. |
| Word Embeddings | Dense semantic representations of words. |
| Word2Vec (CBOW/Skip-gram) | Generates word embeddings using neural networks. |

## Prerequisites

```bash
pip install nltk numpy scikit-learn gensim
```

Required NLTK data packages:
```python
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger_eng')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('maxent_ne_chunker_tab')
nltk.download('words')
nltk.download('tagsets')
```

## Usage

The script demonstrates various NLP techniques on a sample text. Each section of the code shows a different NLP transformation:

1. **Text Tokenization**
   - Word tokenization
   - Sentence tokenization

2. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Stopwords removal
   - Stemming
   - Lemmatization

3. **Linguistic Analysis**
   - POS Tagging
   - Named Entity Recognition

4. **Text Vectorization**
   - One-Hot Encoding
   - Bag of Words
   - N-grams (Bigrams)
   - TF-IDF

5. **Word Embeddings**
   - Word2Vec CBOW model
   - Word2Vec Skip-gram model

## Example Output

```python
# Sample text
text = "Natural Language Processing is a fascinating field. It enables machines to understand human language."

# Tokens output
Tokens: ['Natural', 'Language', 'Processing', 'is', 'a', 'fascinating', 'field', '.', 'It', 'enables', 'machines', 'to', 'understand', 'human', 'language', '.']
```
